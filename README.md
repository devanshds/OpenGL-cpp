# OpenGL-cpp

Tried OpenGL in 2018 in Visual studio. Current main.cpp is capable of drawing a triangle with the help of vertex and fragment shaders. 
180 lines of code just to draw a triangle was fun and time consuming. To be fair, most of it was setting up GLEW and GLFW.

Libraries used:
GLEW 2.1 32 bit
GLFW 3.3.2

My opinion on GLSL(shading language)? Complex and not so fun.
